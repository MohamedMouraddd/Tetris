# Self-Playing Tetris Game

## Overview

This project is a simple C# implementation of a Tetris-like game where the game plays itself. The game features a basic AI that drops tetrominoes into random columns on the board. The game continues to clear full lines and drop new tetrominoes indefinitely.

## Features

- **Random Tetromino Drops:** The game randomly drops tetrominoes (represented by `#`) into columns on the board.
- **Line Clearing:** When a line is completely filled, it is cleared, and the above lines shift down.
- **Real-Time Rendering:** The board is rendered in the console in real-time, allowing you to see the AI's decisions as they happen.
